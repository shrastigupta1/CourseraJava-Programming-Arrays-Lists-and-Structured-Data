Assignment 1: Most Frequent Word
You will write a program to determine the word that occurs the most often in a file. If more than one word occurs as the most often, then return the first such word found. You should make all words lowercase before counting them. Thus, “This” and “this” will both be counted as the lowercase version of “this”. You should not consider punctuation, so “end” and “end,” will be considered different words. Use the WordFrequencies program in the lesson as a starting point.

Specifically, you should do the following:

Create a new project in BlueJ and then create a new class called WordFrequencies. Put all the following items in this class.

Create two private variables. One is called myWords and should be an ArrayList of type String to store unique words from a file, and one is called myFreqs and should be an ArrayList of type Integer. The kth position in myFreqs should represent the number of times the kth word in myWords occurs in the file. 

Write a constructor WordFrequencies, and initialize the private variables. 

Write a void method findUnique that has no parameters. This method should first clear both myWords and myFreqs, using the .clear() method. Then it selects a file and then iterates over every word in the file, putting the unique words found into myWords. For each word in the kth position of myWords, it puts the count of how many times that word occurs from the selected file into the kth position of myFreqs, as was demonstrated in the lesson. 

Write a void tester method that has no parameters. This method should call findUnique. Then print out the number of unique words, and for each unique word, print the frequency of each word and the word, as was demonstrated in the lesson.

Write the method findIndexOfMax that has no parameters. This method returns an int that is the index location of the largest value in myFreqs. If there is a tie, then return the first such value.

Add code to the tester method to determine and print the word that occurs the most often in a selected file and how many times it occurs. You should find it helpful to call findIndexOfMax.

For example, if the file were testwordfreqs.txt:

        This is a test. Yes a test of a test. Test.

Then the output would be:

123456789
Number of unique words: 7
1 this
1 is
3 a
3 test.
1 yes
1 test
1 of
The word that occurs most often and its count are: a 3
We are ignoring punctuation, so note that “test.” and “test” are different, as the first one has a period with it. Also note that there is a tie—two words are counted three times; you should return the first such word found which is “a”.

 

Assignment 2: Character Names
Write a program to determine the characters in one of Shakespeare’s plays that have the most speaking parts. Consider the play “The Tragedy of Macbeth” in the file macbeth.txt. Here are a few lines from the file put into a much smaller file called macbethSmall.txt:

    MACBETH. My dearest love,

        Duncan comes here tonight.

    LADY MACBETH. And when goes hence?

    MACBETH. Tomorrow, as he purposes.

    LADY MACBETH. O, never

        Shall sun that morrow see!

        Your face, my Thane, is as a book where men

        May read strange matters. To beguile the time,

        Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,  

        Your hand, your tongue; look like the innocent flower,

        But be the serpent under it. He that's coming

        Must be provided for; and you shall put

        This night's great business into my dispatch,

        Which shall to all our nights and days to come

        Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.

    MACBETH. We will speak further.

Note that each speaking part is at the beginning of the line (there may be some blanks before it) and has a period immediately following it. Shakespeare used this format in many of his plays. Sometimes the name of the person to speak was all capitalized and sometimes it was not. 

Write a program to print out the main characters in one of Shakespeare’s plays, those with the most speaking parts. You should identify a speaking part by reading the file line-by-line and finding the location of the first period on the line. Then you will assume that everything up to the first period is the name of a character and count how many times that occurs in the file. You will only print those characters that appear more often than others. Notice our method is somewhat error prone. For example, a period is also used to indicate the end of a sentence. By printing out only those characters that appear a lot, we will get rid of most of the errors. Periods that indicate the end of a sentence will likely be a unique phrase so you won’t print that as it would just occur once or maybe twice. 

For the file macbethSmall.txt, if we process it and print ALL the possible speaker characters  and counts found, we would get the following output:

    MACBETH	3

        Duncan comes here tonight	1

    LADY MACBETH	2

        May read strange matters	1

        But be the serpent under it	1

        Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom	1

If we only print those with a count greater than 1, then our output is:

    MACBETH	3

    LADY MACBETH	2

In processing the complete play in macbeth.txt you should not print out every count—you would have too much output, so instead print every count that is greater than or equal to some number (you decide what that number is).  

 

Specifically, you should do the following:

Create a class named CharactersInPlay. Put all the following items below in this class.

You will need to create two private ArrayLists. One to store the the names of the characters you find and one to store the corresponding counts for each character. 

Write a void method named update that has one String parameter named person. This method should update the two ArrayLists, adding the character’s name if it is not already there, and counting this line as one speaking part for this person. 

Write a void method called findAllCharacters that opens a file, and reads the file line-by-line. For each line, if there is a period on the line, extract the possible name of the speaking part, and call update to count it as an occurrence for this person. Make sure you clear the appropriate instance variables before each new file.

Write a void method called tester that has no parameters. This method should call findAllCharacters, and then for each main character, print out the main character, followed by the number of speaking parts that character has. A main character is one who has more speaking parts than most people. You’ll have to estimate what that number should be. Test your method on the file macbethSmall.txt. and then macbeth.txt. 

Write a void method called charactersWithNumParts that has two int parameters named num1 and num2, where you can assume num1 should be less than or equal to num2. This method should print out the names of all those characters that have exactly number speaking parts, where number is greater than or equal to num1 and less than or equal to num2. Add code in tester to test this method out.
